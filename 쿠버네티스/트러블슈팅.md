        Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
                timed out waiting for the condition

        This error is likely caused by:
                - The kubelet is not running
                - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

        If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
                - 'systemctl status kubelet'
                - 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

        Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
        To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI.

        Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in docker:
                - 'docker ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
                Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
                - 'docker logs CONTAINERID'

```



해결 방법 1.

```
The problem was cgroup driver. Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd. So I created '/etc/docker/daemon.json' and added below:
```

```
{
"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}
```

```
 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart docker
 systemctl restart kubelet
```



컨테이너 런타임과 kubelet의 cgroup 드라이버를 일치시켜야 하며, 그렇지 않으면 kubelet 프로세스에 오류가 발생한다.



기존 cgroup은 왜 자동으로 일치가 안돼지? 도커 설치할떄 도커 데몬으로 변경해서 설치해야 하나?

도커 데몬 설정

```
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

```
{
    "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "log-opts" : {
        "max-size": "100m"
    },
    "data-root": "/mnt/storage/docker_data",
    "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker

```
